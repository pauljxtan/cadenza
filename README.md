# cadenza

A simple Elm app for chord analysis.

Demo: TODO

## Roadmap

- [x] Display basic seventh chords given tonic and inversion
  - [ ] More chords (altered, added-tone, suspended, etc.)
- [ ] Render notation (e.g. with [vexflow](http://www.vexflow.com/))
- [ ] Identify possible chord given notes (lots more work needed on the backend)
